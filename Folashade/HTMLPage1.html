            I am a master’s student at Aston University studying Business Analytics, and I enjoy analysing data and generating insights that help businesses make informed decisions.
            <br />Over the course of my degree, I have worked on numerous business analytics projects that have helped me develop my analytical, teamwork and problem solving skills that I can apply to diverse business scenarios.
            I am fluent in using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, SPSS and STATA to solve business problems like Customer segmentation, Sales Forecast, Customer churn and Sentiment Analysis using data.
            <br />I am experienced in Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling, Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning modelling.
            I am a detail-oriented, organised and analytical person who loves learning new things and keeping myself abreast of changes in the industry. I am currently learning how to use PowerBI to create visual reports and dashboards.
            I have an avid interest in data analytics and how it pertains businesses.
